# covid-19_tracker

web is live : https://statistikat.netlify.app/ ;

I created a web where you can find all statistics about covid-19 cases.
I used a API : https://api.covid19api.com/summary;
From API I got all the the statistics and using JavaScript send them to web.
Its not for all states in world but you cn add more on file : main.js;
